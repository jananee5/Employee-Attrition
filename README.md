**Employee Attrition Prediction**
This project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition using machine learning models.
The goal is to understand the key factors contributing to attrition and provide insights for organizational improvement.

🔍 **Overview**
Employee attrition is a critical problem faced by many organizations. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, this project helps identify employees likely to leave the company, enabling proactive measures to improve retention rates.
This app is built with Streamlit, allowing users to interactively explore the dataset and predict employee attrition based on input parameters.

🚀**Features**
**- Data Analysis:** Visualize trends and insights from the employee data.
**- Predictive Modeling:** Use machine learning to predict attrition likelihood.
**- Interactive App:** Explore and test predictions via the Streamlit interface.

📁 **Repository Structure**
📦 Employee-Attrition
├── app.py                    # Main Streamlit app
├── Employee-Attrition.csv     # Dataset used for analysis
├── requirements.txt          # Dependencies required for the project
└── README.md                 # Project documentation


📊 **Dataset**
The dataset is stored in the repository as Employee-Attrition.csv and contains anonymized employee information, including:
- Demographics
- Job role and department
- Performance and satisfaction metrics
- Employment history

⚙️ **How It Works**
- **Data Preprocessing:**- Handles missing data
- One-hot encodes categorical features
- Normalizes numeric data

- **Machine Learning:**- Uses supervised learning techniques to classify employees as "likely to leave" or "likely to stay."

- **Interactive Interface:**- Input employee details and get attrition predictions in real-time.

🛠 **Built With**
- **Python:** Programming language
-**Streamlit:** For building interactive web apps
- **pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn:** Machine learning library
- **matplotlib & seaborn:** Data visualization

🌟 **Future Improvements**
- Incorporate additional datasets for deeper insights
- Enhance the predictive model for improved accuracy
- Add more visualizations for better interpretability
